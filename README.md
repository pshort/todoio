# Todoio

## We have the urgent need of a Todo app!

This is no laughing matter - items are not getting done and we have :wq
no way to know if its us, or the items, or our organization skills or what? What we do know is we need this ASAP!

## This app has no DB

We want to just store 1 list of todos in memory. Who needs more than that?

## First steps

I know I forgot to do something but as I havent finished this todo app Im not sure what it is....
Maybe running

``` bash
mix test
```

will give us a clue.
